# Habit Tracker v0.1 – Description

## Version
v0.1

## Feature
Basic CLI habit/goal tracking with CSV/Excel export.

## Description
This version implements the core workflow for tracking habits and goals using a command-line interface. Users can define multiple goals, specify positive ("Do") and negative ("Don't") activities for each goal, and log their daily progress (Yes/No) for each activity. The program collects this data and generates a simple progress report for all goals for a single day. All data is exported to an Excel file for easy review.

## Key Features
- Add multiple goals via CLI.
- For each goal, add "Do" (positive) and "Don't" (negative) activities.
- Daily logging: For each activity, user enters completion/avoidance (Yes/No).
- Progress report: Shows daily status for all goals and activities.
- Data is saved to Excel (CSV/Excel export).
- No charts or visualizations in this version.
- No AI, no web interface—just CLI and file export.

## Limitations
- Only supports logging for one day at a time (data is overwritten on each run).
- No weekly/monthly summaries (planned for future versions).
- No graphical charts (added in v0.2).
- No AI suggestions or automation.

## Status
[completed]

## Example Output
- Excel file with tables for each goal and their activities, showing daily completion/avoidance status.

## Next Steps
- v0.2 → Add Matplotlib charts for visual progress.
- v0.3 → AI-powered activity suggestions.
- v0.4 → Weekly/monthly/quarterly summaries.
