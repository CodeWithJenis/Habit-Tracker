# v0.2 – Charts with Matplotlib

## Version
v0.2

## Feature
Add charting/visualization to the CLI habit tracker using Matplotlib.

## Description
This version introduces visual progress reports using Matplotlib charts. Users can now view their habit/goal progress as pie charts and bar diagrams, making it easier to understand their performance at a glance.

## Key Features
- Pie charts for "Do" and "Don't" activity completion/avoidance per goal.
- Overall progress pie chart for each goal.
- Bar chart comparing total and missed progress across all goals.
- All charts are generated and saved as images, and can be embedded in Excel reports.

## Implementation Notes
- Use a reusable function for pie chart generation.
- Save all chart images to the project directory.
- Clean up (delete) temporary chart images after exporting to Excel.
- Use pandas and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

## Status
[completed]

## Example Output
- Pie chart: Football Do Activity Progress
- Pie chart: Football Do Not Activity Progress
- Pie chart: Football Overall Progress
- Bar chart: Goal Progress Comparison (all goals)

## Next Steps
- v0.3 → Auto-generate Do/Don’t with AI suggestions.
- v0.4 → Add weekly/monthly/quarterly reports.
