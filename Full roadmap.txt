Perfect 👍 Let’s map your **goal + do’s/don’ts + daily tracking idea** into a **Version 0.1 MVP design** that you can start coding in Python (CLI style).

---

# 🚀 MVP Design for **Habit/Goal Tracker v0.1**

### **🎯 Core User Flow**

1. User enters a **goal** (e.g., *Quit Masturbation*).
2. User adds **Do activities** (positive habits).
3. User adds **Don’t activities** (negative triggers).
4. Each day → User **logs progress** (Yes/No for each activity).
5. User can **view progress report** (per goal, weekly summary). # weekly summary not implmented currently may be in the web (10/3/2025)

---

## **Step 1: Data Storage (CSV)**

We’ll use a simple **CSV file** for persistence.

### Files:

* `goals.csv` → stores goals.

  ```
  goal_id,goal_name
  1,Quit Masturbation
  2,Be Consistent in Career
  ```

* `activities.csv` → stores activities (do/don’t).

  ```
  activity_id,goal_id,activity_type,activity_name
  1,1,Do,Exercise
  2,1,Do,Healthy Food
  3,1,Don’t,Porn
  4,1,Don’t,Masturbation
  ```

* `logs.csv` → daily progress.

  ```
  log_id,goal_id,activity_id,date,status
  1,1,1,2025-08-20,Yes
  2,1,2,2025-08-20,No
  3,1,3,2025-08-20,Yes
  ```

---

## **Step 2: CLI Menu**

User sees menu like:

```
1. Add Goal
2. Add Activity (Do/Don’t)
3. Log Progress
4. View Progress Report
5. Quit
```

---

## **Step 3: Features (v0.1 scope)**

### ✅ 1. Add Goal

* Ask user: “What’s your goal?”
* Save to `goals.csv` with unique ID.

---

### ✅ 2. Add Activity (Do/Don’t)

* Ask: “Which goal does this belong to?”
* Ask: “Do or Don’t?”
* Save to `activities.csv`.

---

### ✅ 3. Log Progress

* Show user today’s activities (all Do & Don’t for that goal).
* User inputs Yes/No.
* Save in `logs.csv` with today’s date.

---

### ✅ 4. View Progress Report

* Show total completed vs total logged.
* Show % success for each activity.
* Example:

  ```
  Goal: Quit Masturbation
  Do Activities:
    Exercise → 5/7 days (71%)
    Healthy Food → 6/7 days (85%)
  Don’t Activities:
    Porn → avoided 6/7 days (85%)
    Masturbation → avoided 4/7 days (57%)
  ```
* Weekly summary only (v0.1).

---

### ✅ 5. Quit

* Exit gracefully.

---

## **Step 4: Roadmap (After v0.1)**

* v0.2 → Charts with Matplotlib. [completed]
* v0.3 → Auto-generate Do/Don’t with AI suggestions.
* v0.4 → Add weekly/monthly/quarterly reports.
* v0.8 → Web/app version 
* v1.0 → Web with chat-based AI coach.

---

👉 So for **Version 0.1**, your task is just:

* Goals → Do/Do Not Activities → Daily Log → Weekly Report. # for now escaped will do in version 0.4 [10/3/2025]

No AI yet, no website yet. Just CSV + CLI menus.
This is **realistic, testable, and portfolio-worthy**.

Would you like me to now **write the Python skeleton code** for this v0.1 (with functions & placeholders) so you can copy into VS Code and start filling in?
